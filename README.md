This React project, built with Vite, serves as a campaign website for a local political candidate running for office in an upcoming election. The website offers various features and technologies to create an engaging and user-friendly experience for visitors.

## Features

- **Donation System**: The website integrates Anedot, a donation system, allowing supporters to easily make contributions to the candidate's campaign.

- **Scroll-Based Animations**: Framer Motion is used to add elegant scroll-based animations. Content elements fade in as users scroll down the page, creating a visually appealing and interactive experience.

- **YouTube Integration**: A YouTube channel was created for the candidate, and the website features embedded videos. Custom thumbnails, designed using Canva, were added to these videos to enhance their visibility and attractiveness on the homepage.

- **Responsive Design**: Media queries were implemented to ensure that the website adapts to various screen sizes and devices, providing a consistent and user-friendly experience on both desktop and mobile.

- **Styling**: Bootstrap was used for styling certain elements, providing a clean and modern design that is in line with campaign branding.

- **Routing**: The React Router library was employed for easy navigation between different sections and pages of the website, ensuring a smooth user experience.

- **Sass**: For a more organized and maintainable CSS, the project utilizes Sass, a preprocessor that simplifies styling.

- **Photography**: High-quality imagery was included to enhance the visual appeal of the website. This includes the main hero image of the candidate and the background image of the hero section, showcasing the candidate's personality and the campaign's message.
